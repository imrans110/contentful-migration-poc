# Contentful Migration Proof-of-Concept (POC)

This repository provides a practical demonstration of Contentful migrations.

---

## :rocket: Getting Started

The following initial steps establish the structure for managing your migrations:

1. **Create a migrations directory**: Establish a directory at your project's root level, where all JavaScript or TypeScript migration scripts will be stored.

2. **Order Migration Files**: Ensure migration files are organized in an incremental order to maintain version tracking.

3. **Develop Migration Running Script**: Implement a script to run the migrations.

4. **Incorporate GitHub Actions**: Utilize GitHub Actions for continuous integration to automate the migration process.

## :gear: Detailed Migration Workflow

The migration process follows these detailed steps:

1. **Create a Migration Branch**: Each new migration should be isolated in a separate branch.

2. **Implement Migration Runner Script**: Develop a script responsible for executing the migrations.

3. **Add Migration File**: Include your specific migration instructions in a migration file.

4. **Export 'master' Environment Data**: Preserve the latest 'master' environment content type data from Contentful by exporting and saving it.

5. **Create Temporary Contentful Environment**: Generate a new Contentful environment as a temporary host during the migration.

6. **Import 'master' Environment Data**: Load the exported 'master' environment data into the new temporary environment.

7. **Run Migrations in Temporary Environment**: Execute the migration scripts in the temporary environment.

8. **Test the Temporary Environment**: Verify the success of migrations and overall system functionality.

9. **Merge Migration Branch**: Once testing confirms the system's proper behavior, merge the migration branch into the master branch.

10. **Execute Migrations on 'master' Branch**: Run migrations on the 'master' branch post-merge.

11. **Remove Temporary Environment**: After successful migration, eliminate the temporary Contentful environment.

12. **Manage Version Tracking**: The migration script should handle version tracking. To preserve version tracking data, introduce a new Content-type on the Contentful space.

## :mag_right: Libraries Tested

During this proof-of-concept, we evaluated two libraries: `contentful-migrate` and `contentful-migration`. Although `contentful-migrate` required less preliminary work, it has lingering unresolved issues. Consequently, we decided on `contentful-migration` for the final implementation.

> **Note**: The preservation of the latest Content Type data from the master environment is crucial due to the lack of rollback support in Contentful.
